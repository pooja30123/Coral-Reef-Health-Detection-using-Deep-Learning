> *Deep Learning for Marine Ecosystem Conservation*

An end-to-end AI system that automatically assesses coral reef health from underwater imagery, providing real-time analysis and conservation recommendations. This system processes point-level annotations to classify coral health into three categories: *Healthy, **Bleached, and **Dead*.

## 🌊 Project Overview

Coral reefs are among Earth's most biodiverse ecosystems, but *50% have been lost in the last 30 years* due to climate change and human activities. Manual monitoring is slow, expensive, and limited in scale. Our AI-powered solution enables:

- *⚡ Real-time Analysis*: 2.3-second coral health assessment
- *🎯 High Accuracy: 79.71% overall accuracy with **95.45% F1-score* for bleached coral detection
- *🌐 Web-based Platform*: Accessible interface for researchers worldwide
- *📊 Comprehensive Reports*: Detailed health metrics and conservation recommendations

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔬 Advanced AI Model
- *Custom CNN Architecture* with 4.9M parameters
- *Point-level Training* on 418K coral annotations
- *Exceptional Performance* in detecting coral bleaching (early warning capability)
- *Grid-based Analysis* processing 132 patches per image

### 🖥 Web Application
- *Drag & Drop Interface* for easy image upload
- *Real-time Visualization* with interactive health scores
- *Conservation Recommendations* based on analysis results
- *Downloadable Reports* for documentation and research

### 📈 Performance Metrics
- *Overall Test Accuracy*: 79.71%
- *Macro F1-Score*: 80.02%
- *Healthy Coral*: F1 = 70.98%
- *Bleached Coral: F1 = **95.45%* ⭐ (Outstanding)
- *Dead Coral*: F1 = 73.62%

    'porites': 'healthy',
    'pocillopora': 'healthy',
    # ... more species
    
    # Bleached: Algae-covered (stress indicators)
    'turf': 'bleached',
    'macroalgae': 'bleached',
    
    # Dead: Damaged/broken coral
    'dead_coral': 'dead',
    'broken_coral_rubble': 'dead'
}


## 📈 Performance Analysis

### Confusion Matrix Results
